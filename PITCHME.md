# Background

+++

## Forks throughout history...
- 1605 J. Sylvester wrote the earliest known example of this particular fork as a verb
  - This fact requires verifaction and might be rather alternative

+++

- "The half life of the teaspoons was 81 days." 
  - [(Aitken 2005)](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.331.7531.1498)
- We lost 95% over 365 days 
  - (Van Mourik et al. 2014, in prep.) 
- Equivalent with fork half life of 84.5 days
- This result has been replicated twice
  - grant number [RIC Fall 2015](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15jg1YHpHG_-xchWnq9zHXQoU33K2eqEI97rbhe0TdVI) 
  - grant number [RIC Fall 2016](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JwDWR4ktyRerZ78i_v9WBSoHi2pvvsan2ejlBvIaXpU)

### #TeamScience.

- Collaborative project (published as: Donders Institute)
- Post request to work on this collaboratively on Facebook
- GitHub open source repository
- Null result, zero DCCN interest
  - H0: Diffusion of responsibility
  - H1: People actually have a life
- Posted Bitcoin bounties 
  - (0.09 Ether, < €30 at the time of posting)

---

# Experimental Question
+++
- We hypothesise that the FFA has always been an acronym for the Fusiform Fork Area.
- They all move to a planet with forkoids
  - [(Adams 1979)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)
- Unknown DCCN employees suffer metallophagia
  - The irresistable urge to eat metal

---

# Materials & Methods

+++
# #TeamScience

- Use GitHub to collaboratively make presentation
- Attach Bitcoin bounties to substeps
- Let Donderians make the content
- Outsource technical issues to India/China/Anywhere
- Online presentation stylesheet
  - Easily present Github'ed analysis

# GitHub Forks

- Github is important for scientists
- F@!king a repository is a legitimate software terminology
  - Meaning: making a branch for you to work on
  - Version controlled

---

# Procedure & Subjects

+++
# We need:
- Equipment: 200 forks * ± €1
- The cost of GPS trackers, cost unknown
- Maybe the CNS department wants to chip in, as they’re also using the kitchen.
- Quills of a Porcupine [Porcupine](https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine) as chopsticks. 
  - Ethical approval for animal research 
  - Request Da Betty e Mora to cook more Chinese

---

# Data Analysis

+++

- Multi-way ANOVA, we determine the F value (fork value)
  - If F < F_crit we need more forks
  - Covariates: food preference, spoon shortage, etc.

+++

MATLAB could not find them either:
```MATLAB
lost_at = 'DondersInstitute'
fork_loc = ft_findForks(forks, lost_at);
```
[Undefined function or variable 'forks'.]()

# Scientific Contribution

+++
# What we learn(t) from this process
- We built a presentation template (GitPitch)
  - easily create minimal online presentation
- Technical issues can easily be outsourced (GitCoin)
- More understanding on the whereabouts of missing forks

---

# May the forks be with you!
